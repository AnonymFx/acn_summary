\section{Patents and Computer Networks}
Companies often have invested a lot of resources into developing a product or service and patents often have significant impact on the economic success of such a firm.
Computer networks rely on interoperable standards which often require patented techniques.
If these techniques are patented, we speak of \textbf{standard-essential patents}.
Without the right (Intellectual Property Rights IPRs) to use it, the standard cannot be manufactured.

\subsection{Patent vs Copyright Law}
The main difference between patents and copyrights are that patents are protections of ideas for which an application is necessary and holds for 20 years from application whereas a copyright includes only a specific form of an invention, does not need an application and lasts 70 years after the death of the author.

\subsection{Patent Law}
To be granted a patent, one has to fulfill several requirements according to the European Patent Convention (EPC):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Invention: have to be new, applicable in industry and involve an inventive step, excluding discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games, doing business, program computers and the presentation of information
  \item Novelty: absolute novelty with no restriction on time, place or person including all publications available
  \item Inventive step: Invention has to have something extraordinary in an area not excluded from invention (technical character)\\
    Methodology:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Determine technical field of invention
      \item Identify closest prior art
      \item Identify differences, effect of differences with an emphasis on technical effects
      \item Deduce technical problem (faster execution speed, higher accuracy,\dots)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Industrial applicaiton
\end{itemize}
